## Management and Delivery System

Despite the situation there have been a few businesses that have been crowded and a necessity such as supermarkets. 
We are aiming to create a solution where these supermarkets can have a way of managing their workload for in-store purchases as well as providing a delivery system. This would be helpful for people who for any reason cannot purchase items in-person or do not have the time to. This way they can do so easily. 
The management system is a way to keep of daily activities in the business and also keep track of statistics, sales, inventory and more. 
### Features we are going to implement:
1. Log-in and register system (different users have different accesses)
2. Pages to keep track of: inventory, orders, sales, statistics.
3. Clients will have a simple page to make their order and check-out.
